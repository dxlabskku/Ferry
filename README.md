# Ferry

Ferry services are one of the vital transportation methods in several nations which connect a huge number of islands and mainlands. However, a major disadvantage of ferry services is that it is crucially affected by weather conditions. Thus, informing customers about the regular ferry service operations is important. Considering this, we aim to predict whether ferry services can be provided in a timely manner through machine learning approaches with their meteorological (6 ~ 48 h prior) and operation datasets.
