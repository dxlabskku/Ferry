# Ferry

### Ferry services are one of the vital transportation methods in several nations which connect a huge number of islands and mainlands. However, a major disadvantage of ferry services is that it is crucially affected by weather conditions. Thus, informing customers about the regular ferry service operations is important. Considering this, we aim to predict whether ferry services can be provided in a timely manner through machine learning approaches with their meteorological (6--48 h prior) and operation datasets. The results indicate that a random forest classifier achieves accuracy levels of 90.50% (6 h) and 88.78% (48 h) in timely ferry services, which are greater than the regulation-oriented determination. Both implications and limitations are presented based on the findings of the current study.
